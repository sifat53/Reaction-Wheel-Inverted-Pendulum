# Reaction Wheel Inverted Pendulum  

This repository contains the implementation of a **Reaction Wheel Inverted Pendulum** using an Arduino microcontroller and a BLDC motor. The project demonstrates the principles of balancing an inverted pendulum using reaction wheel dynamics.

## Project Overview  
The reaction wheel inverted pendulum is a control systems project aimed at balancing a pendulum in the inverted position. The BLDC motor and reaction wheel generate torque to counteract the pendulum's movement, keeping it upright.  

## Features  
- **Hardware:** Arduino microcontroller, BLDC motor, reaction wheel.  
- **Control System:** Implemented PID controller for stability.  
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates feedback control systems and dynamics.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Arduino IDE  
- BLDC motor driver (e.g., ESC)  
- Compatible hardware: gyroscope/accelerometer sensor (e.g., MPU6050).  

### How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/sifat53/Reaction-Wheel-Inverted-Pendulum.git  
   cd reaction-wheel-pendulum  
   ```  
2. Upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.  
3. Assemble the pendulum with the reaction wheel and connect all hardware components.  
4. Power the setup and observe the balancing mechanism.
